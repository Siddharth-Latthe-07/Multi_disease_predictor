# Multi_disease_predictor
In this Project, I have made a web application using Python and its library Streamlit ,that can predict whether the person has any of the disease mentioned in the options tab . Here, I have taken three disease which are (Parkinson, Heart and Diabetes).
The main ideology of this project is to make  a separate machine learning models of the disease mentioned and then combine them in order to get the results. 
There are various criteria's/features through which we can say that a person is diagnosed with the disease.
